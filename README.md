The GCF Lecture's JavaScript Codes

There’s no particular order… so just eyeball whatever you want to learn or revise!

I didn’t bother making files for Day One since it is too basic for that.

You will either need to link this files to your html file or just run them with node.js
search how to run js file using node js on youtube...

Anyway... enjoy the grind! 😁
