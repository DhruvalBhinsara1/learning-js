//The Window Object

//The window object represents the global JavaScript environment. It provides access to all global variables, functions, and objects.

//Window is a global object, which means you don't need to use its name to access its properties or methods.

//Example:

//alert() is a method of browser's window object.

//you can call alert() with 2 ways:

//1. Using the window object:

window.alert("Hello, World!");

//2. Using the alert() function:

alert("Hello, World!");
